# ============================================================================
# NODE.JS API SERVICE — CLUSTERIP
# ============================================================================
# Exposes the API internally within the cluster ONLY.
# ClusterIP means this service has no external IP and cannot be reached
# from the internet. Only pods within the cluster can call it.
# nginx routes /api/* requests to this service by name.
#
# Kubernetes DNS automatically resolves "api-service" to this ClusterIP
# from any pod in the same namespace.
